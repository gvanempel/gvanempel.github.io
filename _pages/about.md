I am currently a PhD candidate at the Centre for Health Economics at Monash University in Australia. My research areas include the intersection of health economics, labor economics, and development economics. My primary PhD research focuses on the environmental effects, such as hospital competition and peer effects, on physicians' decision-making. My secondary research areas focus on development economics, where we conducted a field experiment on vaccine hesitancy.  I am currently working on my job market project, which examines how social capital affects health.

I am a Medical Doctor (by training) from Universitas Gadjah Mada (Indonesia) and before my PhD study, I finished my MSc (w/ Distinction) at the Department of Economics, University of York (UK).
