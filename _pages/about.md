I am currently a PhD candidate at the Centre for Health Economics at Monash University in Australia. My research areas include the intersection of health economics, labor economics, and development economics. My primary PhD research focuses on the environmental effects of delivery of healthcare, such as hospital competition and peer effects, on physicians' decision-making. My secondary research areas focus on development economics, where I was the Co-PI of a field experiment on vaccine hesitancy. I will be on the job market this year (2023-2024).

I am a Medical Doctor (by training) from Universitas Gadjah Mada (Indonesia) and before my PhD study, I received my MSc (w/ Distinction) from the Department of Economics, University of York (UK).
