Giovanni is currently a Research Fellow at the Department of Health Economics, Wellbeing, and Society at the Australian National University. He is an applied economist and physician by training, with a focus on health and labor economics. He holds a PhD in Economics from Monash Business School, Monash University, an MSc (with Distinction) in Health Economics from the University of York (UK), and an MD from Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia.

His research explores the intersection of health, labor, and family economics. One strand examines how organizational features of healthcare systems such as hospital competition and peer influence shape healthcare delivery. A second strand focuses on child and family wellbeing, particularly how parental investments and policy interventions affect human capital formation. He is currently working on an ARC-funded project investigating the effects of counter-COVID policies on childrenâ€™s developmental outcomes. He also had experience in co-leading a JPAL-funded field experiment in Indonesia.
