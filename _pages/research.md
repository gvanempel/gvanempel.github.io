<small>
<p>We study whether multi-technology healthcare providers respond to market entry of specialized single-technology competitors by inducing demand for legacy health technologies. To this end, we use the relaxation of regulatory restrictions in cardiac care in Sweden that led to a rapid expansion in the number of hospitals providing catheter-based treatment only. To establish causality, we exploit a feature of the Swedish healthcare system that restricts patient choice of healthcare providers, allowing providers considerable discretion in allocating patients to treatments. Relating observed treatments of residents in catchment areas where hospitals opened a catheter lab to residents in unaffected catchment areas, we find that patients with clinical indications for cardiac surgery were 10 percent more likely to receive catheter-based treatment after their local hospital opened a catheter lab. In contrast, we find no evidence that incumbent hospitals reduced their use of catheter treatment on their remaining patient population to offset reductions in surgical volume. We conclude that the lack of response to market entry among incumbent providers likely contributed to the swift technological change in the clinical management of acute coronary syndrome in the 2000s.</p>

<p>We study peer spillovers in healthcare by exploring how cardiologists' diagnostic skill is influenced by their work peers' use of radiation when assessing blockages in the heart's vessels. To overcome identification challenges, we use rich clinical quality data from Sweden to instrument peers' average weekly radiation output with the plausibly exogenous arrival of emergency cases they treated in previous weeks. Our empirical estimates imply that focal cardiologists change their own radiation output by 0.5 standard deviations for each standard deviation change in their peers' output. We show that our results are not driven by endogenous peer formation or patient selection, and that effects are stronger in academic hospitals and among younger cardiologists. Estimated peer effects are welfare-enhancing through improving the share of patients who are diagnosed within the recommended radiation dosage range and by reducing subsequent mortality risk.</p>

<p> In settings where resistance and rampant misinformation against vaccines exist, the prospect of containing infectious diseases remains a challenge. Can delivery of information regarding the benefits of vaccination through personal home visits by local ambassadors increase vaccine uptake? We conduct a door-to-door randomized information campaign targeted towards COVID-19 unvaccinated individuals in rural Indonesia. We recruited ambassadors from local villages tasked to deliver information about COVID-19 vaccines and promote vaccination through one-on-one meetings, using an interpersonal behavioral change communication approach. To investigate which type of ambassador---health cadres, influential individuals, and laypersons---is the most effective, we randomly vary the type of ambassador that delivers the information at the village level. We find that the overall vaccination take-up is quite moderate and that there are no differences in vaccination outcomes across the treatment groups. These results highlight the challenge of boosting vaccine uptake in late stages of a pandemic.</p>

<u>Does quality affect choice of family physician? Evidence from patients changing general practice without changing address.</u> <br/>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<small>
<p> Competition by general practices can improve quality only if quality affects patient choice of practice. Each year 1% of English patients leave their practice and join another local practice without changing their address (non-movers). If quality does not affect non- movers’ decisions about leaving or joining local practices it is unlikely it will affect overall demand for a practice. Using 2006/7-2010/11 data on 6766 English practices we estimate fixed effects panel count data models of non-movers leaving and joining practices. Fewer non-movers leave after increases in clinical quality, proportion of patients satisfied with access, doctors per patient, and proportion of doctors qualified in the UK. More join after patient satisfaction with access and doctors per patient increase. A 10% increase in opening hours satisfaction is associated with a 5.75% reduction in non-movers leaving and a 2.9% increase in non-movers joining. Better information on quality could increase practice incentives to improve quality.</p>
